# Gridsome Duotone Theme

This theme is a **Gridsome** fork/port of `hugo-theme-terminal` (https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal)
All the CSS is actually the same of `hugo-theme-terminal`. The main purpose is to rewrite, customize and improve this CSS.
I'm not a CSS expert, so I'll need some help for this.

### 1. Install Gridsome CLI tool if you don't have it

`npm install --global @gridsome/cli` or
`yarn global add @gridsome/cli`

### 2. Create a Gridsome project

1. `gridsome create my-gridsome-site manuelfedele/gridsome-duotone-theme` to install the theme
2. `cd my-gridsome-site` to open the folder
3. `gridsome develop` to start a local dev server at `http://localhost:8080`

### 3. Create a Post or customize 'sample.md'

Posts are placed under `content/posts` directory. You will find a sample post there, named `sample.md`.
Feel free to modify or delete it.

Happy coding ðŸŽ‰ðŸ™Œ
